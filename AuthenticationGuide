Guide on how to set up your local dev environment to be Authenticated. This will change as we develop the app.

1. Download dynamodb from Amazon https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/DynamoDBLocal.html
    I. Put the extracted folder wherever you want. I threw mine in nebula. We currently ignore the folder calledd dynamodb_local
    II. Run java -Djava.library.path=./DynamoDBLocal_lib -jar DynamoDBLocal.jar -sharedDb to start the local dynamodb

2. Go into the nebula-api directory
    I. node dynamoDBDeleteTables.js (may need to do node dynamoDBDeleteTables if you previously had tables set up that are no longer valid)
    II. node generateKey.js Grab the key that is generated.
    III. npm install (just in case it hasn't been run)
    IV. npm start

3. Go into discord-bot
    I. Get the config.json from another developer. This has the secert key for the discord bot
    II. npm install
    III. npm start
    IV. Got to nebula discord server and message the nebula bot directly with the following message: !bind <registation key>

Your discord account is now registered with nebula :D

5. Go into frontend
    I. npm install
    II. npm start

At this point you should be prompted to approve authentication from discord. After that you will have access :D.
Every seven days the token will expire at which point discord will ask for approval again.
